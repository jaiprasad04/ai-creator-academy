# Module Template

Every module is one `<NN>-<module-slug>.md` file directly inside `tracks/<NN>-<track-slug>/` — no per-module subfolder, so browsing a track shows every module's content one click away. Each track has one shared `apps.json` (keyed by module slug) instead of a file per module, and any reusable artifacts go in the track's shared `templates/` folder. Copy this file's shape when writing a new one.

# [Module Title]

> [One-line motto — the core idea that sticks]

**Track:** [Track name]
**Time:** ~[estimated time]
**Prerequisites:** [prior modules needed, or "None"]

## The Problem

[2-3 paragraphs. What can't you do without this? Make it concrete — a real scenario
where not knowing this costs money or time.]

## The Concept

[Explain with plain language and diagrams where useful. No step-by-step yet —
build the mental model first: what's actually happening, why it works.]

## Do It

[Step-by-step walkthrough — the actual workflow, start to finish. Assume the
reader has muapi API access. Every step should be concrete enough to follow
without guessing.]

### Step 1: [Name]
### Step 2: [Name]
[...continue...]

## Compare Tools

[Show the tradeoffs across paths — muapi API vs. other paid tools vs. local/
self-hosted (ComfyUI, local diffusion/video/TTS) where a local option
realistically exists. Be honest about cost, speed, and quality — don't just
say "APIs are easier."]

## Launch It

[The monetization content — this is what most tutorials skip. Cover: how to
price this as a service or product, how to position it, where to find first
clients/distribution, and the real numbers (with sources) so claims are
checkable.]

## Exercises

1. [Easy — reinforce the core concept]
2. [Medium — apply it to a different case]
3. [Hard — combine with a prior module or scale it up]

## Templates

[List the reusable artifacts this module produces, saved in this module's
`templates/` folder — e.g. a prompt template, a pricing sheet, an outreach
script, a checklist.]
```

## Rules for every module

- Follow the beats in order: Problem → Concept → Do It → Compare Tools (if applicable) → Launch It → Exercises. "Launch It" is never optional — it's what differentiates this from a typical "how it works" tutorial. "Compare Tools" applies only to modules teaching a production technique; for pure business/analysis-skill modules (pricing, sales, teardown/analysis) with no real tool comparison, omit the section entirely rather than writing "Not applicable" — fold any genuinely useful carry-over point (e.g. "your cost basis is still set by the tool choice from an earlier module") into Launch It instead.
- **Never name specific competitor course platforms, creators, or "gurus"** as sources, even when they're the actual demand evidence — cite the pattern ("X-style income claims"), not the source.
- **Show your real numbers** wherever a monetization claim is made — cite a verifiable source or mark it as an estimate, never state an unverifiable income figure as fact.
- Every module that teaches a production technique (something an app could plausibly demonstrate) gets an entry in the track's `apps.json` (`status: "existing"` with a `repo_link`, or `status: "needed"`) — never duplicate app code inline. Skip the entry entirely for business/analysis-skill modules whose "Compare Tools" section is "Not applicable" (pricing, sales, teardown/analysis, etc.) — an app pointer for a module that isn't about a tool doesn't mean anything.
