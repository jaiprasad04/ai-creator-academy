# How AI UGC Actually Works

> A UGC ad is just five pieces stitched together — once you can see the seams, you can make any of them.

**Track:** AI Video Ads & UGC
**Time:** ~45 minutes
**Prerequisites:** None

## The Problem

Brands pay real creators $200-$1,500 per UGC (user-generated-content-style) ad because it converts better than polished studio ads — it looks like a real person talking to camera about a product, not a commercial. The problem: sourcing, briefing, filming, and revising human creators is slow, and it doesn't scale. A brand that wants 20 ad variants to test can't get 20 creators on short notice.

AI-generated UGC solves the scaling problem, but most people trying it get stuck on one thing: their AI "creator" doesn't look consistent from shot to shot, or the voice/lip-sync looks obviously fake, and the ad gets rejected. Understanding the actual pipeline — not just "type a prompt" — is what separates a usable ad from an uncanny one.

## The Concept

A UGC-style AI ad is five stages, each producible independently and swappable:

```
Script  →  Avatar / Voice  →  Video  →  Captions  →  Export
```

- **Script** — a short, conversational hook + pitch + call-to-action, written the way a real person talks, not ad copy.
- **Avatar/Voice** — either a generated talking-head avatar with a cloned/synthetic voice, or a still reference image animated with lip-sync driven by an audio track.
- **Video** — the avatar's performance, plus any b-roll (product shots, screen recordings) cut around it.
- **Captions** — auto-generated, burned-in captions, standard for the format because most viewers watch muted.
- **Export** — format/aspect ratio matched to the platform (9:16 for Reels/TikTok/Shorts, sometimes 1:1 or 16:9).

The reason this pipeline matters more than any single "best model" is that each stage can be produced by a different tool, and the weak link is whichever stage looks least real — usually the avatar's face/voice sync, not the script or captions.

## Do It

1. **Write the script.** Keep it under 30 seconds spoken (~75-90 words). Structure: hook (first 2 seconds — a question, a bold claim, or a visual surprise), problem/pitch (10-15 seconds), proof or demo (10-15 seconds), call-to-action (last 2-3 seconds).
2. **Generate the voice.** Use a text-to-speech or voice-cloning model to turn the script into natural-sounding narration. Match tone to the product (energetic for a gadget, calm for skincare) — and don't stop at the first take. Generate 2-3 versions varying pacing and emphasis (which word gets stressed in the hook line changes how "surprised" or "casual" it reads), and pick the one that sounds least like it's being read off a page. Accent/demographic match to the product's likely audience matters here too — a mismatched voice can undercut an otherwise good script.
3. **Generate or animate the avatar.** Either generate a talking-head video directly from the script/voice, or animate a reference image with lip-sync driven by the audio track.
4. **Add b-roll.** Cut in product shots or screen recordings during the pitch/proof section — this also hides any short imperfect stretches in the avatar footage.
5. **Caption and export.** Auto-generate captions, burn them in, and export at 9:16 for short-form platforms.
6. **Ship check.** Before sending anything to a client, watch the finished ad once with sound off (does the hook work from captions alone?) and once with sound on at regular volume. If you catch yourself pausing anywhere to figure out what's happening, a client will too — that's a sign to fix pacing or cut, not just ship it and see.

## Worked Example

Product: a $28 magnetic phone car mount ("GripMount").

**Script** (hook/pitch/proof/CTA, ~28 seconds spoken):

> "Okay, I did not expect this to actually hold my phone through a pothole. [holds up phone, taps mount] I used to have one of those suction ones that fell off literally every drive — this one's magnetic, snaps on in like two seconds. [demo: slaps phone onto mount] It's held through every drive for the last two weeks, potholes included. It's $28, link's below — honestly just get it before your next road trip."

Mapped to the structure:
- **Hook (0-2s):** "Okay, I did not expect this to actually hold my phone through a pothole." — a surprised, specific claim, not generic ("this product is great").
- **Problem/Pitch (2-15s):** names the actual competing product's failure (suction mount falling off) — this is what makes it sound like a real person, not ad copy.
- **Proof/Demo (15-25s):** a visual demo (slapping the phone on) plus a concrete duration ("two weeks, potholes included") — specific numbers read as more credible than "it works great."
- **CTA (25-28s):** price stated plainly, one action ("link's below"), urgency tied to a real use case (road trip) instead of a generic "buy now."

**Why this script would survive production:** it's short enough to keep energy up on one take, the demo moment (slapping the phone on) gives the avatar something to *do* with its hands instead of just talking — which also hides minor avatar imperfections — and it never says "AI" or sounds scripted.

**Common first-attempt mistake:** writing the pitch section like copy ("Introducing GripMount, the revolutionary new way to...") instead of like speech. Read your script out loud before producing anything — if you wouldn't say it to a friend, rewrite it.

**The clip below is real, not a mockup** — the anchor image from Module 2 animated into a short talking clip from the hook line above, so you can see what a first-pass output actually looks like before any editing/b-roll/captions are added:

<p align="center"><img src="templates/examples/gripmount-hook-clip.gif" alt="Generated talking clip (silent GIF preview)" width="280"></p>

<p align="center"><a href="templates/examples/gripmount-hook-clip.mp4">▶ Watch the original with audio (.mp4)</a> — GitHub can't play video inline in a README, so the GIF above is a silent preview; the linked file has the actual voice.</p>

<p align="center"><i>An unedited first pass — lip movement is decent but not perfect, which is normal at this stage. Cutting in b-roll during the pitch/proof section (Do It, step 4) is what usually hides this kind of imperfection in a finished ad.</i></p>

*How this was actually produced, end to end, via the muapi API:*
1. Generated the anchor portrait with **`nano-banana-2`** (text-to-image, $0.06/image) — the same image used in Module 2's example.
2. Uploaded that image via muapi's `upload_file` endpoint to get a URL the next model could reference.
3. Fed that image URL into **`seedance-2-image-to-video-fast`** (image-to-video, $0.75/clip) with a prompt describing the action and the exact line of dialogue — no separate TTS/lip-sync pass was needed, since this model generates speech and mouth movement together from the prompt.
4. Downloaded the resulting `.mp4` from muapi's CDN (generated outputs expire after 30 days, so anything you want to keep needs downloading promptly) and converted it to the silent GIF preview above with `ffmpeg` for inline display.

Total cost for this one clip: **$0.81** across the two model calls. This is exactly the "image → video model, prompt-driven" pipeline described in Do It, step 3 — the models named here are current examples, not a fixed recommendation; see Compare Tools below for how to pick a model when these become outdated.

## Compare Tools

Model names change constantly, but the *category* choice matters more than any specific model — here's what's actually reasonable for each stage right now:

| Stage | Good muapi models to reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Voice/TTS | Gemini TTS, ElevenLabs text-to-dialogue | Natural multi-speaker delivery with emotion/pace control — not robotic TTS |
| Avatar/video (image → talking clip) | Seedance 2.x, Kling 3.0 | Current-generation video models that handle head/hand motion and speech convincingly in one pass, as in the clip above |
| Lip-sync (audio-driven, onto an existing video/image) | A dedicated lip-sync model (e.g. sync-style lip-sync) or a Kling avatar model | Better fit when you already have separately-recorded narration you need to match to a face, rather than generating speech+motion together |

| Path | Cost per ad | Setup effort | Consistency | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **muapi API** (managed) | Per-generation credit cost, no infra | Low — call the endpoint, get a result | High — same model/voice reused via API params | Fast iteration, client work, testing many variants |
| **Other paid all-in-one UGC tools** | Often subscription-gated, per-seat pricing | Low, but locked to their UI/workflow | Varies by tool | Teams that want a GUI, not an API |
| **Local/self-hosted** (ComfyUI + local TTS/video models, e.g. LTX 2.3) | Free after hardware, but needs a capable GPU | High — workflow setup, model downloads, tuning | Can be very high once tuned, but slower to get there | Zero marginal cost at volume, full control, privacy-sensitive clients who don't want cloud processing |

LTX 2.3 is worth naming specifically for the local path: it's an open-weight video model runnable in ComfyUI, so it's the closest local equivalent to the Seedance/Kling-class models above — weaker out of the box, but the only one of this group you can actually run on your own GPU instead of an API call.

The honest tradeoff: local is genuinely free per-generation once set up, but the setup and iteration time cost is real — expect to spend a weekend tuning a ComfyUI workflow before it's reliable. API is the right default while you're still learning what "good" looks like; local becomes worth it once you're producing at real volume (dozens of ads/month) or a client specifically needs on-premise generation.

## Launch It

**How to price it:** Individual UGC-style ad gigs on freelance marketplaces run roughly $10-$55 per finished ad; agencies retainer this work at $1,500-$3,000/month for ongoing batches. Price by deliverable (e.g., "$150 for 5 ad variants") rather than by hour — clients understand ad packages, not your production time.

**How to position it:** Lead with the business outcome ("more ad variants to test, faster, without a film crew"), not the AI process. Brands buying UGC ads care about conversion and testing speed, not how the video was made.

**Where to find first clients:** DTC e-commerce brands running paid social ads are the best fit — they already buy UGC and already understand the format. Cold outreach to brands you can see running Meta/TikTok ads (visible in the platforms' public ad libraries) with a sample ad for their actual product is a stronger opener than a generic pitch.

**The real numbers:** Documented case studies show individual brands running AI-UGC-style creative at $600K+/month in ad spend for a single product — the point isn't that you'll match that, it's that the format is proven at scale, not a novelty.

## Exercises

1. **Easy:** Write three 30-second UGC scripts for a product you use, following the hook/pitch/proof/CTA structure.
2. **Medium:** Produce one full ad end-to-end (script → voice → avatar → captions → export) for a real or hypothetical product.
3. **Hard:** Produce 5 variants of the same ad (same product, different hooks or angles) and compare which hook you'd expect to perform best, and why.

## Templates

Reusable template(s) this module produces — fill these in and reuse them on real work:

- [`templates/ugc-script-template.md`](templates/ugc-script-template.md) — the hook/pitch/proof/CTA script structure as a fill-in-the-blank template.
- [`templates/ad-brief-checklist.md`](templates/ad-brief-checklist.md) — a checklist for briefing yourself (or a client) before producing a batch.
